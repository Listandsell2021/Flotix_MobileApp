# FleetFlow Mobile App - Implementation Notes

## Overview
FleetFlow is a complete React Native mobile application for fleet expense management. This implementation follows all the requirements specified and provides a production-ready foundation for a fleet management SaaS mobile app.

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Authentication Flow
- Login screen with email/password authentication
- JWT token management with automatic refresh
- Secure token storage using AsyncStorage
- User context management

### ✅ Navigation Structure
- Stack navigation for authentication
- Bottom tabs for main app (Create, History, Profile)
- Nested stack navigation for create flow
- Proper screen transitions and state management

### ✅ Create Expense Flow
1. **Upload Receipt Screen**
   - Camera and photo library integration
   - Image picker with preview
   - Optional receipt upload (can skip)
   - Upload to Firebase Storage via signed URLs

2. **Expense Form Screen**
   - OCR processing integration (calls backend)
   - Automatic amount prefill from OCR
   - Fuel vs Misc expense type selection
   - Category selection for miscellaneous expenses
   - Date, currency, and notes fields
   - Form validation and error handling

### ✅ History & Management
- Expense list with filtering (All, Fuel, Misc)
- Pagination support
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Receipt thumbnail preview
- Manual vs OCR badges
- Expense detail view with full receipt preview
- Edit/Delete functionality (with time window restrictions)

### ✅ Profile & Settings
- User information display
- Company details
- Cache management
- Logout functionality
- App version information

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
- Context API for authentication state
- Context API for expense state and form management
- Proper separation of concerns

### API Integration
- Axios client with JWT interceptor
- Automatic token refresh on 401 errors
- Request/response error handling
- Environment-specific API URLs (Android emulator/iOS simulator)

### UI Components
- Reusable Button component with variants
- Custom TextInput with validation
- Toast notifications
- Image picker and preview components
- Receipt modal viewer

### File Upload Strategy
- Primary: Firebase Storage via signed URLs
- Fallback: Mock upload for development
- No native module dependencies

## Environment Configuration

### API URLs
- Android Emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:4000`
- iOS Simulator: `http://localhost:4000`
- Production: Configurable via environment variables

## Key Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@react-navigation/native": "^6.1.8",
  "@react-navigation/stack": "^6.3.17",
  "@react-navigation/bottom-tabs": "^6.5.9",
  "react-native-screens": "^3.25.0",
  "react-native-gesture-handler": "^2.13.1",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^1.19.3",
  "axios": "^1.5.0",
  "react-native-image-picker": "^7.1.0"
}
```

## API Contracts Implemented

All endpoints follow the specified contracts:

### Authentication
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh  
- `GET /me` - Get current user

### Expenses
- `POST /expenses` - Create expense with OCR processing
- `GET /expenses` - List expenses with filters
- `PATCH /expenses/:id` - Update expense
- `DELETE /expenses/:id` - Delete expense
- `POST /expenses/signed-url` - Get Firebase upload URL

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android  
npm run android

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
npm run lint
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Native Setup**: Configure react-native-gesture-handler and react-native-screens native dependencies
2. **Firebase**: Set up actual Firebase project and storage bucket
3. **Environment Variables**: Configure production API endpoints
4. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests
5. **Performance**: Optimize image handling and caching
6. **Offline Support**: Implement offline expense creation
7. **Push Notifications**: Add expense approval notifications
